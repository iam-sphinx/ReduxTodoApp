# ReduxTodo Application

I had made this simple Todo Application for learning basics of redux toolkit.





## Lessons Learned

Store is something called as central hub of data and remember we can only take data from store with help of useSelector() react-redux hook which gives us state info.

const data = useSelector( state => state.slice)

and to save data in store we use useDispatch(reducer(data))

remember we can save data to store with the help of useDispatch which in turn uses reducer to save.

State - Current State

Payload - Data.
